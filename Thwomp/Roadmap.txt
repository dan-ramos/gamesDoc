====== Roadmap ======
Created Thursday 17 August 2023

first up figure out how branches work

* Need a thwomp model
* Thwomp movement? Animation/physical movement
* Demo level ( big rectangular building)
* Instantiate ledges on level that have random holes
* Movement needs to track outside of level, that way he doesn't fall off
* Camera movement to follow whomp's position
* Whomp needs to fall through the holes and land below

Demo level goes infinite until we have a good working engine and understanding of scope

* Trampoline or other transportation to get from level to level
* Enemies ? Obstacles ? 
* Skins?
* Peter griffin ???
